I am an Assistant Professor at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I am based in the [Institute for Technology and Humanity](https://www.ith.cam.ac.uk/) (ITH) and its [Centre for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/) (CHIA). I am also an Official Fellow in Computer Science at [King's College, Cambridge](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/). 

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor & Faculty Fellow at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and a Senior Research Associate at [Alan Turing Institute](http://turing.ac.uk/). I completed my PhD in the [Cambridge Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/). I hold a MS and BS in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/) from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, USA.

### Research
I build trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) systems for high-stakes deployment.  I am keen to develop new algorithms and tools that support effective human-AI interaction and manage the partnership between humans and AI systems. Drawing from machine learning, cognitive science, philosophy, and law, my group and I investigate when and how AI can be trusted, integrated into decision-making, and evaluated in ecologically valid settings. My work pays particular attention to critical domains such as healthcare, education, and national security, where transparency and human oversight of AI systems is essential. 

Over the years, my research has supported by the [Responsible AI Institute](https://www.responsible.ai/), [Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/), [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/), and the [Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) (Trust and Transparency) via generous donations from [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) and the [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/). Stay tuned for details on our soon-to-be-announced Trustworthy AI Laboratory at Cambridge. If youâ€™re interested in joining or supporting us, please get in touch with me.
