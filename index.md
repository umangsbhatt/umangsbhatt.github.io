I am an Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow at the [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I spent my PhD years in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), where I was advised by [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/). Currently, I am also a Research Associate at the [Alan Turing Institute](http://turing.ac.uk/) and an Advisor to the [Responsible AI Institute](https://www.responsible.ai/). My research interests lie in trustworthy machine learning, responsible artificial intelligence, and human-machine collaboration.

My PhD research was funded by the [Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) (Trust and Transparency Initiative) with generous donations from [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) and the [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Summer Fellow at the [Center for Research on Computation and Society](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/) within Harvard SEAS, a Fellow at the [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/) and a Research Fellow at the [Partnership on AI](https://www.partnershiponai.org/). I completed a joint bachelors-masters in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I grew up in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, USA.

<!-- , where I worked with [Jos&eacute; Moura](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~moura/). During four wonderful years in Pittsburgh, I collaborated with [Pradeep Ravikumar](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/) on explainable AI and [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/) on automated pothole detection.[Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/) and [Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/) on robot affect expression in competitive settings, and [Radu Marculescu](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~radum/) on network science for deep learning.  -->
